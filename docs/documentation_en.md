# Lambda Heat Pump Integration - Documentation

## Modbus Communication

The integration communicates with the Lambda WP via Modbus TCP/IP. The communication uses the following Modbus function codes:

- **Reading Registers**: Function code 0x03 (Read Multiple Holding Registers)
- **Writing Registers**: Function code 0x10 (Write Multiple Registers)

### Register Addressing

The registers are addressed as follows:

- Heat Pump: Base address 4000
- Boiler: Base addresses 4100, 4200, 4300, 4400 (for up to 4 boilers)
- Heating Circuit: Base addresses 5000, 5100, 5200, 5300 (for up to 4 heating circuits)
- Buffer: Base addresses 6000, 6100, 6200, 6300 (for up to 4 buffers)
- Solar: Base addresses 7000, 7100, 7200, 7300 (for up to 4 solar systems)

The relative address is added to the base address to obtain the absolute Modbus register address.

### Register Types

The integration supports the following register types:

- **Read-Only**: Sensors and status information
- **Read-Write**: Target temperatures and control parameters

### Data Formats

The registers use the following data formats:

- **int16**: 16-bit signed integer
- **uint16**: 16-bit unsigned integer
- **float**: 32-bit floating point number (two consecutive registers)

### Scaling

The values are multiplied by a scaling factor to obtain the actual values. For example:

- Temperatures: Scaling factor 0.1 (Register value 250 = 25.0Â°C)
- Pressures: Scaling factor 0.1 (Register value 150 = 15.0 bar)
- Flow rates: Scaling factor 0.1 (Register value 100 = 10.0 l/min)

## Structure of the Integration

The integration consists of the following main files:

- **manifest.json**: Contains metadata such as name, version, dependencies (`pymodbus`), minimum Home Assistant version (`2025.3.0`), and configuration details (`config_flow: true`, `iot_class: local_polling`).
- **const.py**: Defines constants used throughout the integration, including the domain name (`DOMAIN`), default values for host/port/slave ID, available firmware versions (`FIRMWARE_VERSION`), and especially the templates for dynamic Modbus sensors (`HP_SENSOR_TEMPLATES`, `BOIL_SENSOR_TEMPLATES`, `HC_SENSOR_TEMPLATES`, `BUFFER_SENSOR_TEMPLATES`, `SOLAR_SENSOR_TEMPLATES`) and their base addresses. The number of instances (heat pumps, boilers, heating circuits, buffer tanks, solar modules) is configured via `num_hps`, `num_boil`, `num_hc`, `num_buffer`, `num_solar`.
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the integration, sets up the central `LambdaDataUpdateCoordinator`, loads the sensor and climate platforms, and registers a listener for configuration changes to reload the integration if needed.
- **config_flow.py**: Implements the configuration flow for setting up the integration via the Home Assistant UI (`LambdaConfigFlow`) and the options flow for adjusting settings after setup (`LambdaOptionsFlow`). The number of instances for HP, Boiler, HC, Buffer, and Solar can be selected during setup.
- **sensor.py**: Defines the sensor platform. The `async_setup_entry` function dynamically creates sensor entities for each configured instance (HP, Boiler, HC, Buffer, Solar) and each template. Firmware compatibility is checked. The `LambdaSensor` class represents a single sensor and fetches its data from the coordinator.
- **climate.py**: Defines the climate platform. For each Boiler and HC instance, a separate climate entity is dynamically created, referencing the appropriate dynamic sensors. The target temperature can be set via the climate entity.
- **coordinator.py**: Contains the `LambdaDataUpdateCoordinator` class, which cyclically reads all configured and compatible sensors (HP, Boiler, HC, Buffer, Solar) and provides the values for the entities.

## Dynamic Sensor and Climate Generation

- The number of heat pumps (`num_hps`), boilers (`num_boil`), heating circuits (`num_hc`), buffer tanks (`num_buffer`), and solar modules (`num_solar`) is set during setup.
- For each instance and each template, sensors are dynamically created (e.g., `hp1_flow_line_temperature`, `boil2_actual_high_temperature`, `hc1_room_device_temperature`, `buffer1_actual_high_temp`, `solar1_collector_temp`).
- Climate entities for hot water and heating circuit are also dynamically created per instance (e.g., `climate.hot_water_1`, `climate.heating_circuit_2`).
- The firmware version is considered: sensors/entities are only created if they are compatible with the selected firmware.
- If the number of any component (boilers, heating circuits, buffer tanks, solar modules) is set to 0, no corresponding entities are created.

## Room Thermostat Control

The integration offers room thermostat control, which allows using external temperature sensors for each heating circuit:

- Activation via the `room_thermostat_control` option during setup or in the options
- After activation, an additional configuration step is displayed where a temperature sensor can be selected for each configured heating circuit
- The selected sensors are stored in the `options` dict of the config entry
- The measured temperatures are transmitted via Modbus to the corresponding registers of the heat pump
- The heat pump uses these values instead of its internal measurements for heating circuit control
- The transmission occurs automatically at regular intervals (configured via `ROOM_TEMPERATURE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`)

## Central Firmware and Sensor Filtering
- The firmware version can be changed later in the options dialog and triggers a full reload (including filtering of sensors and entities).
- Sensors and entities are **centrally** filtered by firmware (see `utils.py`).
- Temperature ranges, steps, and firmware version are configurable at any time in the options dialog.
- Initial values for sensors (e.g. dummy) can be set in const.py.
- When saving configuration and options, the written values are output to the Home Assistant log (DEBUG).

## Home Assistant 2025.3 Compatibility (updated)
- Modern configuration and options flows
- Central filter function for firmware compatibility (`get_compatible_sensors` in utils.py)
- Debug logging when saving configuration/options
- All features and options are fully UI-configurable

## Room Thermostat Control & Modbus Write Process

The integration allows you to select any external temperature sensor from Home Assistant for each heating circuit (dropdown, only non-integration sensors with device_class 'temperature'). Selection is done in the options flow. The measured values are automatically and regularly (e.g., every minute) written to the Modbus registers of the respective heating circuits. This is handled by the service function `async_update_room_temperature` in `services.py`, which reads, validates, and writes the value for each circuit to the correct register via the Modbus client. Errors are logged. The transmission can also be triggered manually via the `lambda.update_room_temperature` service. Each write operation is logged at debug level. The technical implementation and process are documented in `services.py`.

## Disabled Registers

The integration provides the ability to disable specific Modbus registers that are not present in your specific configuration or cause errors. This is particularly useful when:

- Certain sensors are not present in your heat pump configuration
- Modbus errors occur for specific registers
- You want to reduce the number of Modbus requests

### Configuration

1. Enable debug mode in the integration settings
2. Monitor the logs for Modbus errors
3. Note the register addresses from the error messages (e.g., "Modbus error for sensor_name (address: 1234)")
4. Add the addresses to `disabled_registers.yaml`:

```yaml
disabled_registers:
  - 1234  # sensor_name
  - 1235  # another_sensor_name
```

5. Restart Home Assistant

The disabled registers will no longer be queried, which eliminates error messages and improves performance.

### Technical Details

- Disabled registers are loaded when the integration starts
- Configuration is stored in a YAML file in the integration directory
- Register addresses are stored as a set for efficient checking
- Debug logs show the loaded disabled registers
- Checking is performed before each Modbus read operation

## Workflow

1. **Setup (`async_setup_entry` in `__init__.py`)**:
    * When the integration is added via the UI, `async_setup_entry` is called.
    * A `LambdaDataUpdateCoordinator` is created.
    * The coordinator attempts the first data update (`async_refresh()`).
    * The coordinator's data is stored in the `hass.data` dictionary.
    * The sensor and climate platforms (`sensor.py`, `climate.py`) are loaded (`async_forward_entry_setups`).
    * An update listener (`async_reload_entry`) is registered to react to configuration changes.

2. **Platform Setup (`async_setup_entry` in `sensor.py` & `climate.py`)**:
    * Each platform gets the coordinator from `hass.data`.
    * The configured firmware version and instance counts are read from `entry.data`.
    * For each instance and template, sensors and climate entities are dynamically created if compatible with the firmware.
    * All created entities are added to Home Assistant via `async_add_entities`.

3. **Data Update (`_async_update_data` in `LambdaDataUpdateCoordinator`)**:
    * This method is called periodically (according to `SCAN_INTERVAL`).
    * Connects to the Modbus device if not already connected.
    * Reads Modbus registers for each configured instance (HP, Boiler, HC, Buffer, Solar) and each template.
    * Processes raw data based on data type (`int16`, `int32`) and scaling (`scale`).
    * Stores the processed values in a dictionary.
    * Returns the data dictionary. Home Assistant then notifies all dependent entities of the new data.

4. **Configuration Flow (`config_flow.py`)**:
    * **`LambdaConfigFlow`**: Called when the integration is added.
        * `async_step_user`: Shows the initial form (name, host, port, slave ID, debug mode, firmware version, number of HP/Boiler/HC/Buffer/Solar). Firmware options are generated from `FIRMWARE_VERSION`. After input, data is validated and a config entry is created (`async_create_entry`).
        * `async_step_room_sensor`: Called when room thermostat control is activated. Lists available temperature sensors and allows selection per heating circuit.
    * **`LambdaOptionsFlow`**: Called when the user edits integration options.
        * `async_step_init`: Shows the options form (temperature ranges, update interval, firmware version, room thermostat control). The number of instances cannot be changed afterwards.
        * `async_step_room_sensor`: Called when room thermostat control is activated or changed.

5. **Reload on Configuration Change (`async_reload_entry` in `__init__.py`)**:
    * The listener registered in `async_setup_entry` calls this function when config entry data changes (e.g., via the options flow).
    * Unloads the platforms (`async_unload_platforms`).
    * Closes the Modbus connection.
    * Calls `async_setup_entry` again to reinitialize the integration with the new settings.

## Classes and Methods

* **LambdaDataUpdateCoordinator (`coordinator.py`)**
    * `__init__(hass, entry)`: Initializes the coordinator, stores the config entry, and sets the Modbus client to `None`. Passes `config_entry` to the superclass.
    * `_async_update_data()`: Main data-fetching method. Connects, reads all relevant Modbus registers for all configured instances and templates, processes the data, and returns it. Implements error handling for Modbus communication.

* **LambdaConfigFlow (`config_flow.py`)**
    * `async_step_user(user_input)`: Handles the initial setup step. Shows the form and creates the config entry.
    * `async_step_room_sensor(user_input)`: Enables the selection of temperature sensors for room thermostat control.

* **LambdaOptionsFlow (`config_flow.py`)**
    * `async_step_init(user_input)`: Handles the options flow. Shows the form. Updates the main data (`config_entry.data`) if the firmware version changes and saves the remaining options.
    * `async_step_room_sensor(user_input)`: Enables changing the temperature sensors for room thermostat control.

* **LambdaSensor (`sensor.py`)**
    * `__init__(coordinator, entry, sensor_id, sensor_config)`: Initializes the sensor entity. Stores configuration, sets attributes like name, `unique_id`, unit, `device_class`, `state_class`, and precision based on the template.
    * `native_value`: Property that fetches the current value from the coordinator. Scaling is already applied in the coordinator.

* **LambdaClimateEntity (`climate.py`)**
    * `__init__(coordinator, entry, climate_type, translation_key, current_temp_sensor, target_temp_sensor, min_temp, max_temp, temp_step)`: Initializes the climate entity. Stores type, names of required temperature sensors, and temperature limits. Sets attributes like name, `unique_id`, temperature unit, supported features, and HVAC modes.
    * `current_temperature`: Property that fetches the value of `current_temp_sensor` from the coordinator.
    * `target_temperature`: Property that fetches the value of `target_temp_sensor` from the coordinator.
    * `async_set_temperature(**kwargs)`: Method to set the target temperature. Gets the sensor definition from the appropriate template, calculates the raw value for Modbus, writes the value via the coordinator's Modbus client, and updates the local coordinator cache and HA state.

## New Features and Improvements

- Each climate entity (e.g., for Boiler 1, Boiler 2, HC 1, HC 2) now receives its own unique unique_id (e.g., eu08l_hot_water_1_climate).
- Device info is always generated via the central build_device_info helper in utils.py. This avoids duplicate devices in Home Assistant and ensures all entities (sensors, climate) are grouped under the correct subdevice (e.g., "Boiler 2").
- Names of climate entities are generated dynamically and translatably, including numbering if multiple instances exist.
